// NOTE: For the supported attributes, I wanted to use a little currying
// magic so that it could potentially take any method on any arbitrary
// type. The type signature would look like this `[String : (Self) -> (String) -> ()]`
//
// Unfortunately, I couldn't get this to work because the curried type wouldn't be known
// at runtime. Understandable, and my first inclination was to use type erasure to no avail.
// I think if and when Swift adopts language level type erasure, then
// this will be possible. I'm flagging this here to keep that in mind because
// I think that will yield a cleaner design and implementation.
//
// For now, I'm still using currying, but you have to provide an instance to the partially
// applied function.
